# Physics
- **Description**: this notes are meant to bring crystality in thought process of my sister's mind, bring a structured web of concepts and ideas. and also to prepare my own thought process to be ready for any loop-holes.

**DISCLAIMER**: *Mathematics is a "thing" which can be viewed from multiple perspectives, there're many structures from which can be used to percieve the objects of Mathematics, the definition of Mathematics doesn't exist if it had, Mathematics wouldn't be growing; considering the fact "mathematics has a quality called rigor", these notes are just a tiny stone on a mountain of those great structures and objects of mathematics, though i try to be as rigorous as i can, the purpose here is to build a kinda logical web of topics of class 12 NCERT so that i can teach my sister for IIT-JEE with ease.*
