# What is Causing Motion?

__POSTULATES__:
1. The Objects Studied in Physics are Physical.
2. Every Physical Objects Lies in $ R^3 $ Space, $ R^3 $ Euclidean Space.
3. Every Observations are are sequential points on $ R^1 $ Line of Time $ t $; which is varying with the same definite rate for all observers.
4. An Observer Observes Objects just as Objects appears at that particular time $ t $.
5. Every Observations are relative to local Cartesian Space; origin of which lies at where the observer is.
6. A State of an Object is given by two associated varibles, a point on The line of time, and a point in Local Cartesian Space of an Observer.
7. All the Physical Functions from Time ($ R^1 $) to Space ($ R^3 $) are continuous.
