# What is Causing Motion?

__POSTULATE 1__: The Objects Studied in Physics are Physical.
__POSTULATE 2__: Every Physical Objects Lies in $ R^3 $ Space, $ R^3 $ Euclidean Space.
__POSTULATE 3__: Every Observations are are sequential points on $ R^1 $ Line of Time $ t $; which is varying with the same definite rate for all observers.
__POSTULATE 4__: An Observer Observes Objects just as Objects appears at that particular time $ t $.
__POSTULATE 5__: Every Observations are relative to local Cartesian Space; origin of which lies at where the observer is.
__POSTULATE 6__: A State of an Object is given by two associated varibles, a point on The line of time, and a point in Local Cartesian Space of an Observer.
__POSTULATE 7__: All the Physical Functions from Time ($ R^1 $) to Space ($ R^3 $) are continuous.
