**LIST OF NOTES**
- [PHYSICS](/NaxBooks/Physics)
- [MATHEMATICS](/NaxBooks/Mathematics)

________________
*NOTE: these notebooks are not meant to teach to everything, these are just my personal notes, only reason to host it on the internet is a hope! a hope of helping someone who needs it, the goal of these notes is to build a rigorous (but not complete) network of topics till class 12 of NCERT so that i can teach my sister with ease and non-contradicting rational way to prepare for IIT-JEE.*

**THE PURPOSE**
> self written notebooks while either reading or watching something new, helps me learn it by connecting the dots!

**I BELIEVE**
> I believe that having a feeling of a concept is more important than imagination. feeling in a rational way.

i can't define what exactly i mean here, if you're interested checkout my journal, you might find what you're looking for, and if you "feel" i'm lacking a consistent idea, please let me know that!

if you're seeking something **complete and rigorous** set of subjects, forming a web of all the nodes being various subjects on this planet, checkout my another hosted notebooks collections [Koham](/KoHam)
